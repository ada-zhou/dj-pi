DJ Pi
Harrison Bronfeld: Work on getting analog signals to digital signals, setting up one potentiometer hardware and software - work on coding changing the audio, code one special effect

Goal: To create a turntable with two "records" which each controlling the speed of two tracks that we are loading into the pi with the SD card. The rate at which a user turns the records determines how fast/slow the track for that record is playing. We will use a potentiometer for getting that information. There will also be a volume control for each track and a slider in the middle to determine the crossfade. We will also have a button for each record that is play/pause.

Milestone for T-1 week: Get the pi to read analog inputs and play a song without changes. Also, get the potentiometer hooked up to detect the rate the user is turning the "record". 

Resources need: 
3 Panel Mount 10k Log Potentiometer (Breadboard Friendly) - 10K Log 
2 MCP 3008 - 8-Channel 10-Bit ADC With SPI Interface
